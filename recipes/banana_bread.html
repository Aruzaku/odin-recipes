    <h3>Directions:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Place a rack in center of oven; preheat to 350Â°. Grease an 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" metal loaf pan with cooking spray and line with parchment, leaving an overhang on both long sides. In a medium bowl, whisk flour, baking soda, and salt until combined.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk eggs, brown sugar, and butter until smooth. Add bananas and vanilla and whisk until well combined (batter will be slightly lumpy). Fold in dry ingredients until incorporated. </li>
            <li>Pour batter into prepared pan; smooth top with a rubber spatula.</li>
            <li>Bake bread until risen, golden brown on top, and a tester inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached, 50 to 60 minutes. </li>
            <li>Let cool in pan at room temperature at least 1 hour. Using parchment overhang, lift bread out of pan and slice.</li>
        </ol>
